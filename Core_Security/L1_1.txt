# Core security principles

CIA Triad - 
a) confidentiality - permitting authorised access
    Categories:
    - IP
    - PII 
    - PHI
b) Integrity - evaluates ability of attacker's ability to manipulate data

c) Availability - maintains timely and reliable access to services

###

Authentication - process of verifying or proving the identity of principal
    Methods:
    - something you know (PIN)
    - sometihng you have (card)
    - something you are (fingerprints)


###

Non-repudiation - signatory; 
                - provides protection against falsely denying having performed a particular action  


###

Risk - measure of extent to which an entity is threatened by particular event 
Information system-related security risks
Total risks
Residual risk - portion after control is applied
Asset - needs protectionThreat - eventAgent - actor
Vulnerability - weakness

###

Vulnerability - element of risk 

Types of threats:
    a) internal
    b) external
    c) structured
    d) unstructured

Agents - insiders, former emplees, AIs, intelligent agencies, competitors, criminals

Impact - magnitude of harm

###

Ris assessment - process of identifying risks to operations
    labeling and tagging
    valuation
    prioritising
    classification
    ownership

RAR - risk assessment report

Risk identification - finding, recognising and describing risks

###

Risk treatment - 
    Acceptance - not to implement controls (ignoring)
    Avoidance - deciding not to undertake actions 
    Mitigation - implementation of controls (impact is reduced)
    Transfer - passing off risk to 3rd party


###

Qualitative risk analysis - assessment as low, medium or high subject to judgement
    Frameworks:
    - COBIT5
    - OCTAVE
    - NIST RMF
    - OWASP

Qualitative heat map - likelyhood vs impact 

###

Quantitative risk analysis - scientific approach based on facts, estimators
    Methods:
    - classic Whitman method (asset value x exposure factor)
