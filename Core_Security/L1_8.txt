# Present Threats & Network Security Controls

APT - advanced persistent Threats (playing the "long game" untill successful)

Spoofing - faking sending address, IP address, DNS
Phishing - disguised email to trick 
Vishing - voice phishing 
Smishing - SMS phishing

DoS - denial of service (overwelm server)
a) Buffer overflow - make machine consume all CPU or memory 
b) Flooding attack - high number of packets

DDoS - distributed denial of service

Virus - attached to exe or runtime code
Worms - distribute copies of themselves
Trojans - code that masquerade as legitimate application

On-path attack - attacker is in the middle between client and server
Ransomware - form of crypto malware

###

Threat prevention tools:
Antimalware/antivirus - 
Firewall - 
IPS (intrusion protection system) - internet > firewall > IPS > server
IDS (intrustion detection system) - 
SIEM Systems - centralise the storage and analysis of logs (e.g. Splunk)

###

Threat Prevention Methodologies
- know what you have
- have robust patch management initiative 
- disable unnecessary service ports
- use endpoint protection- implement security principles (zero trust, SoD etc)

Vulnerability scanning - process to identify weakness in Systems
Vulnerability scanners - Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP

Compliance scanning - if system compliant with policies and requirments 

###

Data center security:
HVAC/Environmnetal controls (temperature 72-76, humidity 40-60)
Fire safety (smoke sensors, suppression)

###

Cloud computing and Security 
IaaS - where capability provided to consumer is to provision:
        a) processing, 
        b) storage, 
        c) networks and 
        d) other fundamental resources

PaaS - to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure:
        a) consumer created applications and 
        b) tools supported by the provider

SaaS - to use provider's application running on a cloud infrastructure through interface

Types of cloud:
> Public - owned by provider
> Private - dedicated to single customer
> Community - shared between similar (e.g. government agencies)
> Hybrid cloud - combination

CASB - cloud access security broker (software or hardware)

###

Secure Network Design
> Zoning - zone has separate networks
> VLAN - to partition network (groups a set of devices into different broadcast domains)
> DMZ - demilitarized zone (perimeter network that allows to access untrusted networks)
> Honeypot/net - decoy network (looks like real network but hosted on one server)

###

Zero Trust Initiatives:
- least privileged
- SoD
- attribute based access

###

Micro-segmentation
- divides a network into fine-grained, isolated segments 
- to control traffic between workloads, containers, and other endpoints
- limit traffic based on principles of least privilege 
- to reduce the attack surface
