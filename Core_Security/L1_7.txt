# Network and security infrastructure

Types and devices:
a) Internet (public)
b) Intranet (private)
c) Extranet (business)

Topologies:
- backbone
- central hub
- ring
- mesh
- tree
- point to point

PAN - personal 
LAN - local
CAN - campus
WAN - wide
MAN - metro or municipal

Network Hub - layer 1 devices (forward packets of information)
Network Switch - manages physical networks
WAP (wireless access point) - allows to form networks
Multilayer switches - provide operational layers of the OSI model
Router (gateway) - connect networks, manages traffic, forward packets to IP addresses
Endpoint - connects hubs, switches and access points, devices that connect to networks

Types of endpoints:
- personal computers
- servers
- pads 
- cll phones
- smart TV
- VMs

Servers - central repo for data and programs shared by users
Firewalls - 
Netxt-gen firewall - inspection, security, prevention, VPN, active defense

###

Device Adressing Mechanisms

IP network device - MAC address (48 bit, 12 digit hexadecimal number), assigned to device
IPv4 - 32-bit number, uniquely identifies network interface on a machine
IPv6 - 128-bit value identifies endpoint device

###

Small Business Network
business: Internet > Firewall > Router > Switch > Servers or/and PC 
home: Internet > ISP modem > Firewall > Router > Wireless App > Laptop

###

ISO/OSI Reference model:
7 Application (HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP)
6 Presentation (ASCII, PNG, AVI, MPEG)
5 Session (SSL, SQL, NFS)
4 Transport (TCP, UDP, SPX)
3 Network (IP, IPX, ICMP)
2 Link (PPP/SLIP, Ethernet, ATM)
1 Physical (binary transmission)

TCP/IP reference model:
Application < Transport < Internet < Network  

###

Logical ports
- used to identify host on a network

FTP - 20 and 21
SSH - 22
Telnet - 23
SMTP - 25
DNS - 53
HTTP - 80
POP3 - 110
SSL/TLS - 443

UDP ports:
FTP - 21
DNS - 53
NTP - 123
Authentication service - 113

###

TCP Hanshake - used to set up connection over IP-based network
Client > Server (SENT - RECEIVED)
Cleint < Server  (Established - Established)

###

TLS - transport layer security [protocol]
- replaced SSL
- encrypting communication between applications (browsers, apps, servers)
- protects VoIP, LDAP, POP3, HTTP

###

IP security:
- collection of protocols 
- encrypts connection between devices on the internet 
- native to IPv6
- Host A > Routeer A > Router B > Host b

###

Virtual LAN- logical subnet of devices 
Router > Shared hub > LAN > PC 

###

Wi-Fi - networking protocol to communicate wthout cable connection
- 802.11 IEEE

WPA2 (wifi protected access) - network security suite
WPA3 - require use of PMF (protected management frames)
