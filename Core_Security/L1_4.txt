# Business Continuity Planning

Business continuity - maintain operations

Goals:
- establish operations when negative event occures
- ensure business operates
- populate risk register
- identify procedures to recover from disaster

###

RCP components:
1) IRT - incident response team
2) BIA - business impact analysis
3) DRP - 
4) BU/R - backup and restore

NIST BCP:
- develop coninuity planning policy statement
- conduct business impact analysis
- identify preventive controls
- create contingency strategies
- develop information system contingency plan
- ensure plan testing, training and exercise
- after action report
- ensure plan maintenace 

other components:
- list of BCP team members
- checklist of procedures
- notification systems

###

BIA - Business impact analysis

- risk assessment aspect of BCP
- identify critical functions
- identify metrics

RPO - recovery point objective (point, relative to disaster, where recovery process begins)
Based on:
- database logs
- snapshots
- last known good configuration
- recovery volume

RTO - recovery time objective (time avaialbel to recover resource, service and function)
MTD - maximum tolerable downtime
MTBF - mean time between failure (the longer the better)
MTTR - mean time to repair (the shorter the better)

###

Backup and restore policies
1) Full backup - everything, takes long
2) Incremental backup - any new file or changed file (store changes), quick
3) Differential backup - slow to backup, quick to restore
4) Snapshot - virtual copy/image, replicated to cloud (virtual copy)

###

Distater recovery:
- ensure you can help org to recover to an acceptable level from any type of negative event
- contain dtailed steps

DR Cycle: detection > response > mitigation > remediation > reporting > LL

###

DRP components:
- escalation procedures
- technical aspects involved
- order of restoration
- backups 
- contacts
- communication plan
- chain of authority and delegates
- stepby-step instructions
- recovery sites
- location of assets (keys, licenses, software)

Sites:
HOT - best recover time (expensive) (RT 24-48 hours)
WARM - moderate (RT 24-48 hours)
MOBILE - moderate (RT 24-48 hours)
COLD - low cost ((RT 72+ hours)
RECIPROCAL agreement - cheap (RT 12-48)
CLOUD - (RT 0-24 hours)

###

Plan testing:
- read through (checklist) > look for missing elements
- tabletop (team in the room) > gap analysis
- walk-through (active drill for department) > scheduled
- simulation (send teams to site)
- parallel (bring recovery site to state of operational readiness)
- full interruption (shut down ooperations) > expensive

AAR - to document knowledge gained from exercise (LL)
