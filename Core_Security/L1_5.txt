# Physical access controls

Access control concepts:
- implemented to allow and restrict access to objects
- process of granting or denying requests

Elements:
- subjects (people, hardware) > joiners, movers, leavers
- [resource] objects (files, tables, programs)
- roles (owners, custodians, stewards, processors, officers)
- rules (instructions permit or deny access)

###

Defence in Depth pronciples:
> layered defence
> applied to physical security and technical controls
> involve end-to-end security
> assets > admin controls > logical and technical controls > physical controls

###

PAM - privileged access management , helps protect against threat actors by monitoring, detecting and mitigating unauthorised access to critical resources
(blend of tools and processes)

1. Local admin accounts
2. superuser (sudo)
3. Emergency accounts
4. service accounts
5. Application accounts
6. Guest accounts
7. Shared accounts
8. Cloud IAM accounts

PIM - privileged identity management

###

SoD - Segregation of duties 
Pricniple - No user should control entire lifecycle of a system or transaction

Two-person integrity:
- require presence of two authorised personel

###

Badge system and gate entry
- mechanism to detect, monitor, deter and prevent direct contact with object, facility

Types:
- bar code
- QR code
- magnetic stripe
- proximity card
- smart card
- hybrid

Endpoint physical security:
- cables and locks
- disable ports
- smart cards and tokens
- locking drawers
- restricted switch ports
- airgaps (certificates)
- geotagging

###

Environmental controls design
- environment needs monitoring
- ingress and egress access points

CPTED - crime prevention through environmental design

###

Biometrics
1. Fingerprints - most common (integrated into mobile and laptop)
2.  Facial - fastest (principal component analysis)
3. Iris - front portion of eye
4. Retinal scanning - back portion of eye
5. Voice recognition - 
6. Vein pattern

FAR - False Acceptance Rate - ratio of of false acceptances / number of attempts
FRR - Falses Rejection Rate -incorrectly rejects
CER - crossover error rate -  where FRR == FAR

###

Monitoring systems:
a. Cameras - combined with recording, lighting and alerts
b. Guards - provide rapid response 
c. Sensors - photoelectric, passive infrared, vibration, acoustical, microwave, eleterostatic, moisture
d. Alarms - light, bell, text
e. Rebot setries
