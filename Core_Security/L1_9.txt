# Data Security & System Hardening

Data lifecycle:
1. Create (generated) > data owner identified
    - discover, categorise, classify, map
2. Store 
3. Use
4. Share
5. Archive
6. Destroy

###

Store
- protection at rest

###

Use
- by people, apps, tools
- changed from original state
- data becomes information

###

Share
- visible, analysed by users
- IAM should be used

###

Archive
- stored for long term
- removed from active used
- archiving is automated
- aspects (location)

###

Destroy
- no longer accessable or usable
- custodians have own disposal methods

###

Logging and monitoring security events

Syslog:
- protocol defined in RFC5424
- sends system info or event messages to a designated server or SIEM system
- used to gather device logs in a centralised fashion
- uses dedicated ports

Levels: emergency, alert, critical, error, warning, notice, info, debug

SIEM:
- combination of security event management and info management

Capabilities:
- collect logs
- log analysis
- IT compliance
- App log monitoring

SOAR:
- security orchestration automation and response
- involves performing security related tasks without human intervention
- can be defensive detection, response, remediation or offensive 

###

Cipher - algorithm used for encryption

Symmetric key cryptosystem:
- the same key for encrypt and decrypt
- efficient, fast, high throughput, inexpensive
- hash (40 to 512 bits)
- AES-CBC-128

Asymetric Key Cryptosystem:
- pair of public and private keys
- slower, longer
- great for signatures
- RSA, ECDSA, ECDH

Hashing:
- converts data into fixed length string 
- 128 to 512 bits- used in authentication
- SHA1, SHA256

Digital signature:
- mechanism for authenticity
- random private/public key pair
- RSA, DSA

###

System Hardening:
- eliminate means of attack by patching vulnerabilities
- turning off nonessential services (ports)
- applying updates, patches

Configuration management:
- identification
- baseline
- change control
- verification and audit

Patch management:
- CMDB should be maintained
- inventory > asessment > gap analysis > assess risk > apply tested patch
