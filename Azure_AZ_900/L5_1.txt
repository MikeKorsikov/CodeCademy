TEST:
1 Transaction optimized - default tier for Azure shared folder
2 Creation: File share>SSS resource>group>installagent>register agent>add server
3 CLI variables start with $ prefix
4 Passing context in PowerShell - New-AzStorageShare -Name "fileshare2" -Context $ctx.Context
5 Storage Sync Service - acts as the central management point for syncing your on-premises file servers with Azure file shares.
6 Create purview account>register SA as Data Source>Set up authentication >Configure scan>Run
7 TCP port 445 â€“ Required for SMB protocol (used by Azure Files)
8 /etc/fstab - file in Linux to place mount command
9 SA must be created before shared folder is congfigured
