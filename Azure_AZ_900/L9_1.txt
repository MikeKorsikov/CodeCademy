Azure Containers

Application container - executable software package that includes everything needed to run a specific application. 
- logical app isolation boundry
- entire app or a single app component

Microsorvices:
- specific app functionality
- allows for app component decoupling

Content of container:
- scripts, filesystem
- libraries
- runtime environment 
- config files

Benefits:
- portable
- quick

###

Docket Host

on Linux:
> sudo apt install docker.io
(docker engine installed)

www.hub.docker.com

> sudo docker images << to show existing images

***

on Windows:
CLI or GUI (Docker Desktop Installer.exe)

> docker images < to list images
> docker pull alpine < to install image

###

Building image from Dockerfile:

$ sudo service docker status
$ sudo nano dockerfile < create a file
$ sudo docker build -t webap1 .

###

Creating container registery:
- repository for container images
home> create a resource > marketplace > container registry > create

Container instance - running instance of a Docker container

Image = blueprint (e.g., a recipe)
Container instance = actual running application (e.g., a cooked dish)

TEST:
1 Docker Hub and ACR - derive container images from
2 Hyper-V and WSL apps allow to run Linux container on Windows Docker host
3 sudo docker images < shows all local images
4 Dockerfile - expected name to build an image
5 sudo docker tag < CLI command to rename local container image
6 containerized application appear to the host OS as a running process.
