# Azure Application Service

- platform as a service
Accomodating resource:
App service plan

###

Deploying app via portal: 
home > create a resource > Web App
Runtime stack: (development language, e.g. Python)
Pricing plan: size of the machine (GB, CPU)

###

Deploying app via Visual Studio:
- establish connection with Azure
- new project (azure resource group)
- select template (web app)

###
Deployment slots:
- to have multiple environments (test, staging, prod) for testing and deployments
home > app services> webapp1 > deployments > deployment slots

###

(assumes you own custom domain with domain provider)
Custom DNS Domain Name:
home > app services > webap1 > settings > custom domains > add custom domain
Domain: (custom domain)
Azure and custom domain names will point to the same IR.

###

Enabling HTTPS:
- if you dont want to use azure name but instead custom domain
home > app services > webap1 > settings > custom domains > add binding

(you need to generate and upload certificate)
home all resources > vault1 > certificates > create certificate

home > app services > webap1 > settings > certificates > bring your own certificate 
source: import from key vault

Use certification authority instead of self-signed certificates.

###

Content delivery network (CDN):
- example of know and widely used cloudflare.net
- network of servers to deliver web content
- servers located close to users to improve performance (latency)

Settings:
-geo filtering
- compression
- caching rules
- HRRPS custom domains

###

Enabling CDN: 
home > app services > weapp > networking > create a new front door

TEST:
1 App Service Plan - stores the underlying VM sizing configuration
2 Production - default web application deployment slot
3 azurewebsites.net - default DNS domain suffix for newly created Azure web sites
4 To deploy app via Visual Studio - ricgh click on solution, choose deploy
5 Characteristic 2 - associated with autoscaling
6 Azureedge.net - default DNS domain suffix for an Azure CDN configuration
7 443 port - default listening port for HTTPS
8 Benefit of CDN - Reduced network latency
