# Azure VNet Peering & VPNs

VNet peering - connect two or more Azure Virtual Networks (VNets)
- improved network performance
- via private IP connectivty

Managed via:
a) Portal:
home > virtual networks > vnet1 > Settings > Peering > add
[IP address space should not overlap]


b) CLI:
Variables start with $
az network vnet peering create --name vnet1tovnet2...

c) PowerShell:
Add-AzVirtualNetworkPeering -Name vnet1-vnet2 ...

###

VPN - encrypted network tunnel linking VPN endpoints
 Protocols:
 PPTP - depricated (not secure)
 L2TP
 SSL/TLS 

Client-to-site VPN:
- single endpoint to private network 
- VPN client assign IP from IP address pool 
User > VPN client software


Site-to-site VPN:
- links networks 
On-prem network - local gateway - virtual gateway - azure services
VPN client software not required

###

CA - certified authority
PKI - public key infrastructure 
Root certificate - certificate of a trust chain that you create and sign yourself
Client certificate [X.509] - to authenticate client to server

###

Configure site-to-site VPN:
home > create a resource > marketplace > virtual network gateway 
Gateway type: VPN 

home > create a resource > marketplace > local network gateway 
Settings > Connections > Add
connection type: site-to-site 

###

Configure point-to-site VPN:
a) set up virtual network gateway object
b) home > all resources > vpn > settings > point-to-site configuration 
c) download VPN client (zip)
d) install on client 

###

Azure ExpressRoute
- service offering 
- private ddicated wide area network (WAN) circuit 
- require to configure on-prem router

a) Create ExpressRoute resources 
b) Provide service key to internet provider
c) Configure on-prem 
d) Link 

###

TEST:
1 For point-to-site VPN, you need virtual network gateway.
2 For site-to-site VPN, you need local and VPN gateways.
3 To create peering - az network vnet peering create
4 Confidentiality - primary benefit of VPN 
5 (Get-AzVirtualNetworkPeering -ResourceGroupName Rg1 -VirtualNetworkName VNet1 | Select-Object PeeringState).PeeringState
6 PKI certificates using hash - to sign certificates 
7 Benefits of peering - private IP addresses, MS global backbone network.
8 
9 Benefit of ExpressRoute - predicatable bandwidth, isolation from public internet traffic
