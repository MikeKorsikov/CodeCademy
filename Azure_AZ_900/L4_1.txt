# Managing Azure Storage

Storage Account (SA) - resource part of IaaS

SA contents:
1. Blobs (binary large objects) 
- blob == file
- file storage
- organised within containers
- types: block, page, append

2. File shares
- shared folders in the cloud
- accessable via drive mappings and mount points (SMB and NFS respectively)

3. Queues
- drop and read messages in the queue
- message is not available to other processes

4. Tables
- NoSQL-based
- support querying
- tables contain entities

###

Settings:
a) Access keys - to entire storage account
b) Shared access signatures - to individual blob or subset of data
c) Encryption - MS or customer managed
d) Geo-replication for high availability

###

SA Tiers:
1. HOT - frequent access
2. COOL - infrequent access (30 days ore more)
3. ARCHIVE - offline (set at blob level)
