###
Managing Service Principles:
add role assignment (of resource) to service principal

Managing Managed Identities:
1- resource > security > identity > enable managed identity > (id generated)
2- resource > IAM > add > role assignment > assign to : managed identity (from list)

###
Enabling MFA:
home  > users > user1 > ... > MFA > (tickbox) > enable

Steps:
1) Enter email and default/initial password
2) Microsoft authentication app
3) Enter new password
4) next time login only via Microsoft Authentication App

###
Conditional access:
(depends on premium license)
named locations > + IP ranges location
home > security > conditional access > create new policy
(specify what is allowed, and other variables)

###
SSPR - self service password reset
home > security > authentication methods 
home > users > manage > properties > selected > choose group

###
TEST:
1 Enabled - means MFA configured but not in effect
2 SSPR - user can unblock own account and sign in
3 Configuration of Enterprise app - results in creation of service principal
4 Passwordless login - prevents password spraying and phishing
5 Service principal benefit - ability to assign permissions to the app
6 Named locations are needed - to create conditional access policies 
7 Federation, Linked - are valid SSO methods
8 Biometric, PIN authentications - used to authenticate with MS Authenticator app
9 Claim - assertion about user or device attribute during federation authentication
10 FIDO 2 key - physical hardware key that plugs as USB
11 To assign permission to code running on VM - enable VM managed identity.
