# Azure Fundamentals

Cloud computing - metered self-provisioned IT services accessable over a netwrok

Characteristics:
- resource pooling 
- broad access
- rapid elasticity
- on-demand self-service
- metered usage

###
CSP - cloud service provider

Resource pooling - CSP equipment available for cloud tenants
Resources appear infinite.

Broad access - accessable over private or public network.
Support for any type of device.

Rapid elasticity - easily add/remove/resize storage, VM

On-demand self-service - user deploys and managers resources
CSP technicians are not involved.
Control provided to tenants.

Metered usage - usage tracked by the CSP.
Charges based on service usage and storage.

### 

Virtualisation 
- operating system virtualisation requires hypervisor.

Type 1 hypervisor - dedicated, it is an OS, runs on HW
Type 2 hypervisor - runs as an app, good for testing, developing but not PROD
App virtualisation - 
App containers - 
Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI or AVD)
Software-defined networking (SDN)

VM Sprawl - easy provisioning of VM but easy to forget about unused VMs

###

Cloud deployment models:
a) Public cloud - available to anybody over the internet (CP owns infrastructure)
b) Private cloud - owned and used by single org, full config control
c) Hybrid cloud - full config control but leverage public cloud
d) Community cloud - tailored for specific needs of government organisations

###

ADC - azure dta center
Locations not disclosed

AZ - availability zone
Has 1 or more ADC

IaaS cloud service model
- storage
- network addressing and routing
- network security
- computer services (VMs, containers)

Responsibilities:
CSP - hypervision, network equipment, physical storage  
Tenant: VM deployment and management (patching), VNets, storage provisioning 

Examples:
- storage accounts
- virtual machines
- virtual networks
- azure firewall

Benefits:
- quicker than on prem provisioning 
- accessible from anywhere

Managed via:
- GUI (graphical user interface) / Azure Portal
- CLI (command-line interface)
- Azure PowerShell
- API 
- Templates
