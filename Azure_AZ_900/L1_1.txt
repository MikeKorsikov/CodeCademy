# Azure Fundamentals

Cloud computing - metered self-provisioned IT services accessable over a netwrok

Characteristics:
- resource pooling 
- broad access
- rapid elasticity
- on-demand self-service
- metered usage

###
CSP - cloud service provider

Resource pooling - CSP equipment available for cloud tenants
Resources appear infinite.

Broad access - accessable over private or public network.
Support for any type of device.

Rapid elasticity - easily add/remove/resize storage, VM

On-demand self-service - user deploys and managers resources
CSP technicians are not involved.
Control provided to tenants.

Metered usage - usage tracked by the CSP.
Charges based on service usage and storage.

### 

Virtualisation 
- operating system virtualisation requires hypervisor.

Type 1 hypervisor - dedicated, it is an OS, runs on HW
Type 2 hypervisor - runs as an app, good for testing, developing but not PROD
App virtualisation
App containers
Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI or AVD)
Software-defined networking (SDN)

VM Sprawl - easy provisioning of VM but easy to forget about unused VMs
