Deploying VM extensions

Extension - software that enables post-deployment configurationand automation
home > virtual machines > vm1 > settings > extensions and applications > Add

Examples:
Monitoring
Security
Scripting
Backup
Antimalware 

###

Capturing VM image - creating snapshot of VM disk state
home > virtual machines > vm1 > Overview > Capture

Used for:
- replicating environments (create VM from image)
- standardizing deplyment
- preserve system state

###

AVD - Azure Virtual Desktop
- cloud based VMs
- accessable via browser or Windows client
- user must be assigned to use AVD
- user account must exist in Azure AD

AVD Host pool - collection of VMs configured to deliver remote desktops.
Pooled - multiple users share the same session host
Personal - user assigned dedicated VM

Deployment: 
home > create a resource > create a host pool

Process:
a) create host pool
b) create host VM
c) create application group (AG)
d) Assign users to AG

###

Access VDA via browser:
a) rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com
b) Enter AAD Tenant GUID and click Submit button
c) Click on Session Desktop icon

###

Microsoft Defender - security platform
- provides threat protection, compliance monitoring
- provides recommendations
- sends security alerts about attacks

home > storage accounts > sa1 > Security + networking > Microsoft Defender for Cloud

TEST:
1 Disk encryption set - is required to configure disk encryption
2 VM redeployment - when VM network connectivity is sporadic
3 AVD client - has benefit of app start menu integration
4 VM extension - is a software agent
5 SSH protocol - is used to manage Linux hosts
6 MS Defender for Cloud - provides VM security recommendations, data classification (purview)
7 Scaling up - adding CPUs to VM
8 Private SSH key - must be stored with user management device (client)
9 When VM is deployed - Azure resources are created (number depends on config)
10 Azure compute galery - stores VM images
11 Credentials - PwerShell parameter to specify username and password
12 az vm resize -g Rg1 -n WinSrv2022-2 --size Standard_DS3_v2
13 Session Host - to add VM to AVD host pool
14 az vm list --query [].name < to list VM names
15 Access AVD - Connect to the generic URL, sign in with assigned user credentials
16 VM size - determines how many disks can be attached to VM
