###
Azure Firewall:
- protects VN resources by controlling traffic using stateful packet inspection, high availability and scalability
- block traffic from known malicious IPs
- Basic, Standard and Premium
- attached to a Virtual Network

Application rule - filter traffic based on FQDN

###
TEST:
1 purpose of configuring network rules for Azure Firewall - To deny access to external networks
2 purpose of configuring application rules for Azure firewall - To deny specific outbound access
3 purpose of configuring DNAT - To translate inbound internet network traffic and route it to specific internal resources
4 Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -ResourceGroupName <name> -Name <name> - PowerShell command retrieves a single Azure network security group
5 Azure Firewall Basic - designed for organizations that are just starting their cloud journey
6 Azure network security groups - service is used to create Azure NSG
7 az network nsg list - in CLI lists all Azure network security groups
8 primary purpose of Azure network security groups - To filter and control network traffic within the Azure environment
